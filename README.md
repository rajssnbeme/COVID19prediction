# COVID19prediction

To predict mortality risk and severity for covid-19 patients, we combined deep learning predictive 9 models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Auto Encoder (AE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE). These models were tested with clinical datasets using fold Cross Validation (CV).The integration of the SMOTE-CV-CNN model performed better than the other models, generating an accuracy of 98.1%, according to the findings of our study.
